# 🎮 2D Platformer Game

This is a 2D platformer game project made with Unity, inspired by **Rehope Games' "Make a Game | 2D Platformer"** tutorial playlist on YouTube.

The game features elements similar to **Geometry Dash**, with creative twists such as trap obstacles, movement-based controls (instead of jumping), and a health management system.
